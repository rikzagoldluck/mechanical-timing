# This option affects the scenario when a client subscribes to a topic that has
# retained messages. It is possible that the client that published the retained
# message to the topic had access at the time they published, but that access
# has been subsequently removed. If check_retain_source is set to true, the
# default, the source of a retained message will be checked for access rights
# before it is republished. When set to false, no check will be made and the
# retained message will always be published. This affects all listeners.
#check_retain_source true

# QoS 1 and 2 messages will be allowed inflight per client until this limit
# is exceeded.  Defaults to 0. (No maximum)
# See also max_inflight_messages
#max_inflight_bytes 0

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages currently inflight per
# client.
# This includes messages that are partway through handshakes and
# those that are being retried. Defaults to 20. Set to 0 for no
# maximum. Setting to 1 will guarantee in-order delivery of QoS 1
# and 2 messages.
#max_inflight_messages 20

# For MQTT v5 clients, it is possible to have the server send a "server
# keepalive" value that will override the keepalive value set by the client.
# This is intended to be used as a mechanism to say that the server will
# disconnect the client earlier than it anticipated, and that the client should
# use the new keepalive value. The max_keepalive option allows you to specify
# that clients may only connect with keepalive less than or equal to this
# value, otherwise they will be sent a server keepalive telling them to use
# max_keepalive. This only applies to MQTT v5 clients. The default, and maximum
# value allowable, is 65535.
#
# Set to 0 to allow clients to set keepalive = 0, which means no keepalive
# checks are made and the client will never be disconnected by the broker if no
# messages are received. You should be very sure this is the behaviour that you
# want.
#
# For MQTT v3.1.1 and v3.1 clients, there is no mechanism to tell the client
# what keepalive value they should use. If an MQTT v3.1.1 or v3.1 client
# specifies a keepalive time greater than max_keepalive they will be sent a
# CONNACK message with the "identifier rejected" reason code, and disconnected.
#
#max_keepalive 65535
